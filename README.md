Reflection in images is a big problem in photography. In this project, we implement and evaluate one the recent [algorithms](https://dilipkay.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/reflection5.pdf) described in literature that attempt to computationally remove reflections. Multiple images were tested on the algorithm and various test cases have been shown towards the end.
